     * The AB class itself is annotated with @Extract instructing
     * the runtime to deconstruct it into its constituents.
     * This will cause it to reflectively traverse the object engine looking for
     * fields annotated with @Extract.
     *
     * In this example there are just two fields A and B with this annotation.
     * The deconstruction of AB into A and B means that A and B become available for
     * being matched by stepForall in the engine. Hence they can be processed in parallel.
     * In this example we simply print out the A and B instances.
