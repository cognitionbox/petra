     * Traditionally Fork/JoinMain is about forking and joining threads.
     * Petra is a data focused programming paradigm, we are only interested
     * in splitting data and transforming it in parallel where possible, then combining result.
     *
     * The example below shows to steps which get called in parallel repeatably,
     * until a certain condition is met and their results are joined.
     *
     * The aim is to increment X and Y integer values from 0 upto 10 in parallel,
     * then combine X and Y back into a result which can be returned.
     *
     * We do this using a combination of steps and joins.
     * Steps always run first and execute in parallel where possible.
     * Joins always run in the order they are defined, sequentially after all steps finished.
