     * X is marked @Extract and contains two references to A, which is also marked @Extract.
     * X also contains a reference to a list marked @Extract.
     * This list an extension of PList.
     * PList is part of a family of Petra cross-runtime-mode collections, including:
     * PSet, PMap etc. These collections can be used in SEQ, PAR and DIS modes out the box.
     * (DIS mode requires the common contained by the collections to be Serializable).
     * In order for a collection to be deconstructed it must be extended and its extension
     * must be marked @Extract. Future versions will allow @Extract to be used directly on
     * the collections with out the need for extended them.
     *
     * X will be matched by PrintA and then be deconstructed into 6 A's.
     * 2 from the A references directly referenced in X and 4 within the list of A's referenced by X.
     * Resulting in 6 A's being printed.
